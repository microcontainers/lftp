[LFTP](https://lftp.yar.ru) is a sophisticated file transfer program supporting
a number of network protocols (ftp, http, sftp, fish, torrent). Like BASH, it
has job control and uses the readline library for input. It has bookmarks, a
built-in mirror command, and can transfer several files in parallel. It was
designed with reliability in mind.
